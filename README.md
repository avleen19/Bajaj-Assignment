# Bajaj-Assignment
Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop and deploy a RESTful API endpoint (/bfhl) that processes an input array received via a POST request. The API must identify and return the following details: the user's unique ID, email ID, college roll number, status of the request, an array of even numbers, odd numbers, uppercase alphabets, special characters, the sum of all numeric values (as a string), and a concatenated string of all alphabetical characters in reverse order with alternating capitalization. The user ID is to be generated using a predefined format including the full name and date of birth. The solution emphasizes proper input parsing, error handling, clean code structure, and adherence to API best practices. The API is built using Node.js and hosted on Render, and the codebase is publicly available on GitHub.
